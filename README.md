# kafka-movie

We need something to exchange. We will send and receive Movie objects. 
Create Movie class with the following content:

```
public class Movie {
    public String title;
    public int year;
}
```


In Kafka, we produce and consume records. A record contains a key and a value. Let’s say we will use the movie’s publication year as key and the title as value.

We also need to decide on which topic we are going to send these records. Let’s keep things simple and name our topic movies.


- start your broker with: docker-compose up -d
- run the application using: ./mvnw quarkus:dev
- In another terminal, emit a few HTTP POST request such as:
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"year":2010, "title":"Inception"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/kafka-movie-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
